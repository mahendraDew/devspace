- GitHub OAuth App for authentication

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/devspace.git
    cd devspace
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
    NEXTAUTH_URL=your_deployment_url
    GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
    GITHUB_GITHUB_SECRETCLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_super_secret_next_auth_secret"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GET_STREAM_API_KEY=your_Get_Stream_api_key
    GET_STREAM_SECRET_KEY="your_Get_Stream_Secret_Key"
    ```
    - for local development you can use the NEXTAUTH_URL as:
        ```
        NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ```
    - for NEXTAUTH_SECRET you can run any of the following command (run on your terminal)
        ```
        node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
        ```
        You can quickly create a good value on the command line via this openssl command.
        ```
        $ openssl rand -base64 32
        ```
4. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
